            Write a small program that will open a file whose filename is given by the variable ``filename`` and prepend each line by its line number, starting from 1. For reading purposes, 4 columns will be reserved for the line number which will be right-aligned, then one space will separate the line number from the first character of the line.

            Example :

            .. code-block::

                 1 This is the first line.
                 2 This is the second line.
                   ...
                10 This is the tenth line.
                   ...
              1000 This is the thousandth line.

            Jimmy learned that his high school stores student grades in a Python list of the following structure :

            .. code-block:: python

                [
                    {
                        "name": "Jimmy",
                        "grades":
                         {
                              "French": 10,
                              "English": 14,
                              "Math": 8,
                              "History": 12,
                              "Science": 6
                        }
                    },
                    ...,
                    {
                        "name": "Jennifer",
                        "grades":
                         {
                              "French": 18,
                              "English": 18,
                              "Math": 16,
                              "History": 15,
                              "Science": 16
                        }
                    }
                ]

            Jimmy ask you to write a Python code that will open the file ``classroom.pickle`` containing these information and change his grades under 10 to 10 or more. You'll then save these information back in the pickle.
