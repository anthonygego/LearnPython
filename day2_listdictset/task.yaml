            You are given a list containing dictionaries that represent articles information and you are interested in sorting the list according to the product price. The given list has the following structure :

            .. code-block:: python

                [
                    {
                        name: "Keyboard",
                        price: 10.5
                    },
                    ...
                    {
                        name: "Motherboard",
                        price: 70.4
                    }
                ]

            Write a small function ``sorted_by_price(the_list)`` that will return the list sorted by articles prices.
